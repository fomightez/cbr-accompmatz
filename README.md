# cbr-accompmatz
Companion repository for my [circos-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/circos-binder) repository. This contains the accompanying material and guides that are aside from the core Circos software and tutorials.

The notebooks here get copied into active sessions launched from the 'circos-binder' repository [here](https://github.com/fomightez/circos-binder). To learn more about Circos, see [here](https://github.com/fomightez/circos-binder).

To use these notebooks actively, click the `launch binder` badge below:

## Technical Details

This was done so that development of the accompanying material for the circos-binder repo could continue without need for rebuilding the associated images at MyBinder.org or Cyverse.
